## [Unreleased]

Changes on `main` since the `v0.2.0` tag.

### Added

- Sign-in, failed sign-in and sign-out are recorded in the audit log, with how
  the user signed in (password, SSO or first-start setup).
- A sign-in throttle slows down repeated failed sign-ins.
- 3D preview of NX parts (`.prt`) from the JT tessellation NX stores in the
  file, refined along its exact surface normals so round faces stay round.
  The thumbnail of an NX part is rendered from it instead of the small JPEG
  stored in the file.
- 3D preview and thumbnail of NX assemblies, put together from the previews
  of their part files (found by file name, sub-assemblies included).

### Changed

- Accessibility: an automated check runs on every rendered page; keyboard
  flows were completed and the Escape key closes panels.
- The MCP tools are split by area (`src/mcp/tools.rs`); no behaviour change.
- The service functions for requests are split into smaller modules; no
  behaviour change.
- The invariants of the remaining mutating service functions are documented.

### Fixed

- The reference scan records the names of STEP exports as a second name, and
  no longer reports noise for JT files.
- The duplicate-files report counts the files of a hidden revision correctly.
- Two administrators can no longer remove each other at the same time.
- The command line commands write their log output to standard error.

### Security

- Web requests that change data are refused when they carry the session cookie
  but neither an `Origin` nor a `Referer` header (cross-site request forgery).
- `Strict-Transport-Security` is sent when the public URL uses `https://`.
- Changing one's own password ends the other sessions of the user.
- The file readers for untrusted uploads (CAD, mesh, point-cloud and BOM
  table files) no longer panic on malformed input.
- The child processes that convert files start with a cleared environment.
